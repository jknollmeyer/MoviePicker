What is it?
-----------
MoviePicker is an Android appliction that prompts multiple users for search parameters and returns a movie that most closely matches these entered values. MoviePicker also displays a Rotten Tomatoes web page with information about the randomly selected movie. MoviePicker chooses a movie based on an edited text file from IMDB containing a lengthy list of movies. CinemaFriends presents Version 1.0 of MoviePicker, and hopes to expand the app in order to offer more search parameters, a more robust movie selection algorithm, and a cleaner UI in the future.

How to Run
----------
MoviePicker's home screen first prompts for how many people are using the app. The main activity screen has two sliders for the user to selected both a genre and a time period. If there are multiple users, a dialogue box will prompt the user to pass the phone to the next user in order for them to enter in their own search parameters. Once all users have entered information, MoviePicker will return the movie it selected. Users then have the option to learn more about this movie in the Rotten Tomatoes webpage or start over.
